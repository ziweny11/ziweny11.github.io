## Teaching Experience

Currently, I am a graduate student at Carnegie Mellon University focusing on my research in computer vision and robotics. While I don't have formal teaching responsibilities at the moment, I am passionate about sharing knowledge and contributing to the academic community.

### Future Teaching Goals

I look forward to opportunities to:
- **Teach Computer Vision Courses**: Share my expertise in 3D reconstruction, photometric registration, and Gaussian Splatting
- **Mentor Students**: Guide undergraduate and graduate students in research projects
- **Develop Course Materials**: Create educational content for computer vision and robotics
- **Lead Workshops**: Organize hands-on sessions on emerging technologies

### Areas of Expertise

- **Computer Vision**: 3D reconstruction, photometric registration, depth estimation
- **Robotics**: Multi-robot systems, environment representation, autonomous navigation
- **Machine Learning**: Foundation models, optimization techniques, deep learning
- **Programming**: Python, PyTorch, computer graphics, real-time systems
