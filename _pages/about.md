I’m a MSCS student at Carnegie Mellon University, advised by Prof. Fernando De la Torre. I received my B.S. in Artificial Intelligence from CMU in 2025, and previously worked with Prof. Matt Johnson-Roberson and his amazing team.

My research lies at the intersection of 3D vision, deep learning, and their applications. I am currently interested in Gaussian Splatting, and focus on developing novel and efficient representations for photorealistic reconstruction.
