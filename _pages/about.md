I’m a Master student in Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University, advised by Prof. Fernando De la Torre. I received my B.S. in Artificial Intelligence from CMU in May 2025, and previously worked with Prof. Matt Johnson-Roberson.

My research lies at the intersection of 3D computer vision, deep learning, and their applications, where I focus on developing novel approaches and efficient representations for photorealistic scene modeling and 3D reconstruction.
