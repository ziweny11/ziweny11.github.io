  title={Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?},
  author={Einstein*†, A. and Podolsky*, B. and Rosen*, N.},
  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},

  title={PhotoReg: Photometrically Registering 3D Gaussian Splatting Models},
  author={Yuan, Ziwen and Zhang, Tianyi and Johnson-Roberson, Matthew and Zhi, Weiming},
  abstract={Building accurate representations of the environment is critical for intelligent robots to make decisions during deployment. Advances in photorealistic environment models have enabled robots to develop hyper-realistic reconstructions, which can be used to generate images that are intuitive for human inspection. In particular, the recently introduced 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), which describes the scene with up to millions of primitive ellipsoids, can be rendered in real time. 3DGS has rapidly gained prominence. However, a critical unsolved problem persists: how can we fuse multiple 3DGS into a single coherent model? Solving this problem will enable robot teams to jointly build 3DGS models of their surroundings. A key insight of this work is to leverage the duality between photorealistic reconstructions, which render realistic 2D images from 3D structure, and 3D foundation models, which predict 3D structure from image pairs. To this end, we develop PhotoReg, a framework to register multiple photorealistic 3DGS models with 3D foundation models. As 3DGS models are generally built from monocular camera images, they have arbitrary scale. To resolve this, PhotoReg actively enforces scale consistency among the different 3DGS models by considering depth estimates within these models. Then, the alignment is iteratively refined with fine-grained photometric losses to produce high-quality fused 3DGS models. We rigorously evaluate PhotoReg on both standard benchmark datasets and our custom-collected datasets, including with two quadruped robots.},
